# Understanding Arrays and Hashing DSA Problems: Patterns and Solutions

## Introduction

Arrays and Hashing are fundamental concepts in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) that form the backbone of many programming solutions. Understanding the common patterns in these problems is crucial for developers, as they appear frequently in coding interviews and real-world applications. This blog post will explore key patterns that emerge in Arrays and Hashing problems, providing you with a comprehensive toolkit for solving these challenges efficiently.

## Pattern 1: Two-Pass Hash Map

### Description
The Two-Pass Hash Map pattern involves making two passes through the data: one to build a frequency map or lookup table, and another to find the solution using the collected information.

### Context and Importance
This pattern is essential when you need to track frequencies or relationships between elements and can't solve the problem in a single pass. It's particularly useful when dealing with counting problems or finding specific elements based on certain criteria.

### How to Recognize
- The problem involves finding elements that meet specific frequency-based criteria
- You need to know the frequency of all elements before making decisions
- The problem asks about finding unique or duplicate elements

### Approach
1. Create a hash map to store element frequencies or relationships
2. First pass: Populate the hash map
3. Second pass: Use the hash map to find the solution
4. Return the result based on the criteria

### Example Problem
Find the first non-repeating character in a string and return its index.

### Solution
```python
def first_unique_char(s: str) -> int:
    # First pass: Build frequency map
    char_freq = {}
    for char in s:
        char_freq[char] = char_freq.get(char, 0) + 1
    
    # Second pass: Find first unique character
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char_freq[char] == 1:
            return i
    return -1
```

### Algorithm Explanation
The algorithm first creates a frequency map of all characters in the string. Then, it iterates through the string again to find the first character whose frequency is 1. This approach ensures we have complete information about character frequencies before making any decisions.

## Pattern 2: Single-Pass Hash Map

### Description
The Single-Pass Hash Map pattern involves solving the problem by maintaining and updating a hash map while iterating through the data only once.

### Context and Importance
This pattern is crucial for optimizing solutions where we can make decisions on the fly without needing complete information upfront. It's especially useful for problems involving running sums or finding pairs.

### How to Recognize
- The problem can be solved by keeping track of previously seen elements
- You need to find pairs or combinations that satisfy certain conditions
- The problem involves running calculations or cumulative results

### Example Problem
Given an array of integers and a target sum, find two numbers that add up to the target.

### Solution
```python
def two_sum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

### Algorithm Explanation
As we iterate through the array, we store each number and its index in the hash map. For each number, we check if its complement (target - current number) exists in the hash map. If found, we've found our pair.

## Pattern 3: Array as Hash Map

### Description
This pattern uses an array as a hash map when the input range is known and limited, providing O(1) access time with better space efficiency than a traditional hash map.

### Context and Importance
When dealing with a limited range of values (like ASCII characters or small integers), using an array instead of a hash map can be more efficient in terms of both space and time.

### How to Recognize
- The input range is known and limited
- The problem involves counting or tracking frequencies
- Memory optimization is important

### Example Problem
Given a string, determine if it contains all unique characters.

### Solution
```python
def has_unique_chars(s: str) -> bool:
    # Assuming ASCII characters
    if len(s) > 128:
        return False
    
    char_seen = [False] * 128
    for char in s:
        val = ord(char)
        if char_seen[val]:
            return False
        char_seen[val] = True
    return True
```

### Algorithm Explanation
Instead of using a hash map, we use a boolean array to track seen characters. Each index represents an ASCII value, and we mark True when we see a character. If we encounter a character that's already marked True, we've found a duplicate.

## Pattern 4: Prefix Sum Array

### Description
The Prefix Sum pattern involves creating an array where each element is the cumulative sum of all previous elements, enabling efficient range sum queries.

### Context and Importance
This pattern is essential for problems involving range sums or when you need to calculate sums of subarrays quickly.

### How to Recognize
- The problem involves calculating sums over ranges
- You need to perform multiple range-based queries
- The input array doesn't change (static)

### Example Problem
Given an array nums, calculate the sum of elements between indices left and right inclusive.

### Solution
```python
class NumArray:
    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        self.prefix_sum = [0]
        for num in nums:
            self.prefix_sum.append(self.prefix_sum[-1] + num)
    
    def range_sum(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        return self.prefix_sum[right + 1] - self.prefix_sum[left]
```

### Algorithm Explanation
We precompute a prefix sum array where each element is the sum of all previous elements. To find the sum of a range [left, right], we subtract the prefix sum at left from the prefix sum at right + 1.

## Pattern 5: Counting Sort Technique

### Description
This pattern uses counting sort principles to solve problems involving frequencies or sorting when the range of possible values is limited.

### Context and Importance
When dealing with a limited range of integers or characters, this pattern can provide O(n) time complexity for sorting or frequency-based operations.

### How to Recognize
- The input range is limited
- The problem involves sorting or frequency counting
- Time complexity needs to be optimized

### Example Problem
Sort an array of integers containing only values 0, 1, and 2.

### Solution
```python
def sort_colors(nums: List[int]) -> None:
    counts = [0] * 3
    # Count frequencies
    for num in nums:
        counts[num] += 1
    
    # Reconstruct array
    index = 0
    for i in range(3):
        while counts[i] > 0:
            nums[index] = i
            index += 1
            counts[i] -= 1
```

### Algorithm Explanation
We first count the frequency of each number (0, 1, 2). Then we reconstruct the array by placing each number in order based on its frequency count.

## Pattern 6: Rolling Hash

### Description
The Rolling Hash pattern involves maintaining a hash value that can be efficiently updated as we slide through an array or string.

### Context and Importance
This pattern is crucial for string matching problems and when we need to compare substrings or subarrays efficiently.

### How to Recognize
- The problem involves substring or subarray comparisons
- You need to perform sliding window operations with hash values
- Pattern matching is required

### Example Problem
Find all occurrences of a pattern in a string using rolling hash.

### Solution
```python
def rabin_karp(text: str, pattern: str) -> List[int]:
    if not pattern or not text:
        return []
    
    # Constants for rolling hash
    p = 31
    m = 10**9 + 9
    
    # Calculate pattern hash
    pattern_hash = 0
    for char in pattern:
        pattern_hash = (pattern_hash * p + ord(char)) % m
    
    # Calculate rolling hash for text
    n, k = len(text), len(pattern)
    curr_hash = 0
    p_pow = pow(p, k-1, m)
    result = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        curr_hash = (curr_hash * p + ord(text[i])) % m
        
        if i >= k:
            curr_hash = (curr_hash - ord(text[i-k]) * p_pow) % m
        
        if i >= k-1 and curr_hash == pattern_hash:
            if text[i-k+1:i+1] == pattern:
                result.append(i-k+1)
    
    return result
```

### Algorithm Explanation
We use a rolling hash function to efficiently compute hash values for substrings of the text. As we slide through the text, we update the hash value by removing the contribution of the leftmost character and adding the contribution of the new rightmost character.

## Conclusion

Understanding these patterns in Arrays and Hashing problems is crucial for developing efficient solutions to complex programming challenges. Each pattern serves a specific purpose and can be applied to various problem types. By recognizing these patterns and understanding when to apply them, you can approach array and hashing problems with confidence and develop optimal solutions.

Remember that mastering these patterns requires practice. Try to identify which pattern would be most appropriate for each new problem you encounter, and don't be afraid to combine multiple patterns when needed. With time and practice, you'll develop an intuition for choosing the right approach for any given problem.
