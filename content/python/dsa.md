Of course. I can definitely modify the script to generate a single `_meta.global.js` file with the structure you've outlined. This approach is much cleaner for managing Nextra's configuration.

I'll update the script to:

- Stop creating individual `_meta.json` files.
- Generate one `_meta.global.js` file in the root of the output `pages` directory.
- Dynamically build the "Domain Specific Sidebar Configurations" based on the top-level folders in your Notion export.
- Include the static, top-level navigation you provided.

I've also included the separator logic you asked for. Here is the updated script.

### Placeholder for Separators in Notion

To create a separator in your sidebar, simply create a blank page in Notion and name it following this pattern: `--- Your Separator Title ---`.

For example, a Notion page named `--- Core Concepts ---` will be automatically converted into a separator with the title "Core Concepts" in the generated sidebar.
