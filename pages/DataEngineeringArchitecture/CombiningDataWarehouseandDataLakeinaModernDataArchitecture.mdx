# Combining Data Warehouse and Data Lake in a Modern Data Architecture

## Introduction

In the era of big data and rapidly evolving data management requirements, organizations are faced with the challenge of effectively managing and extracting value from their diverse data sources. The traditional relational data warehouse, while still a crucial component, often struggles to keep up with the volume, variety, and velocity of modern data. On the other hand, the data lake, with its ability to store and process unstructured and semi-structured data, has emerged as a complementary solution. 

The modern data warehouse (MDW) architecture combines the strengths of both the relational data warehouse and the data lake, creating a more robust and flexible data management ecosystem. In this article, we will explore the MDW architecture, discuss the different approaches for integrating the data warehouse and data lake, and provide a case study example of a company transitioning to this modern data architecture.

## The Modern Data Warehouse (MDW) Architecture

The modern data warehouse architecture is designed to address the limitations of the traditional data warehouse and leverage the benefits of the data lake. The key components of the MDW architecture are:

1. **Data Lake**: The data lake serves as a centralized repository for raw, unstructured, and semi-structured data from various sources, such as web logs, sensor data, and social media. This data is stored in its native format, allowing for flexible and scalable storage.

2. **Data Warehouse**: The data warehouse continues to play a crucial role in the MDW architecture, serving as the source of truth for structured, curated, and transformed data. It is optimized for fast query performance and supports traditional business intelligence and reporting use cases.

3. **Data Orchestration and Transformation**: The MDW architecture incorporates a robust data orchestration and transformation layer, which facilitates the movement and processing of data between the data lake and the data warehouse. This layer ensures data quality, consistency, and adherence to business rules.

4. **Analytics and Insights**: The MDW architecture supports a wide range of analytical capabilities, from traditional business intelligence to advanced analytics and machine learning. Users can access data and insights from both the data warehouse and the data lake, depending on their specific needs.

The key benefit of the MDW architecture is its ability to combine the strengths of the data warehouse and the data lake, providing a comprehensive and flexible data management solution. This allows organizations to:

- Ingest and store large volumes of raw, unstructured data in the data lake
- Curate and transform relevant data for structured analysis in the data warehouse
- Leverage the data lake for exploratory and advanced analytics, while maintaining the data warehouse for mission-critical reporting and business intelligence

## Approaches for Integrating Data Warehouse and Data Lake

There are several approaches for integrating the data warehouse and data lake within the MDW architecture. Let's explore the most common strategies:

1. **EDW Augmentation**:
   - In this approach, the existing enterprise data warehouse (EDW) is augmented with a data lake.
   - The data lake serves as a landing zone for raw, unstructured data, while the EDW continues to be the primary source of truth for structured, curated data.
   - Data is selectively moved from the data lake to the EDW based on business requirements and data governance policies.
   - Pros: Leverages existing EDW investments, gradual transition, and maintains data governance.
   - Cons: Potential data duplication, increased complexity in data management, and potential performance issues due to data movement.

2. **Temporary Data Lake plus EDW**:
   - In this approach, a temporary data lake is used as an intermediary step before data is loaded into the EDW.
   - The data lake serves as a staging area for raw, unstructured data, where it can be processed, transformed, and prepared for loading into the EDW.
   - Once the data is ready, it is then moved from the data lake to the EDW.
   - Pros: Allows for flexible data processing, reduced load on the EDW, and improved data quality.
   - Cons: Increased complexity in data management, potential for data duplication, and the need for additional infrastructure and resources.

3. **All-in-One Solution**:
   - In this approach, the data warehouse and data lake are fully integrated, with the data lake serving as the primary data repository and the data warehouse acting as a specialized analytical store.
   - Data is ingested into the data lake, and the data warehouse is populated with curated, transformed data based on business requirements.
   - This approach leverages the scalability and flexibility of the data lake while maintaining the performance and analytical capabilities of the data warehouse.
   - Pros: Streamlined data management, reduced data duplication, and improved flexibility in data processing and analysis.
   - Cons: Requires a significant investment in infrastructure and resources, and may have a steeper learning curve for the organization.

## Case Study: Transitioning to a Modern Data Warehouse Architecture

Let's consider the example of a large retail company that is transitioning from a traditional data warehouse to a modern data warehouse architecture.

**The Challenge**:
The company's existing data warehouse was struggling to keep up with the growing volume and variety of data, including customer behavior data, product information, and supply chain data. The IT team recognized the need for a more flexible and scalable data management solution to support the company's business objectives.

**The Approach**:
The company decided to adopt a modern data warehouse architecture, which would combine the strengths of a relational data warehouse and a data lake.

1. **EDW Augmentation**:
   - The company's existing enterprise data warehouse (EDW) was maintained as the primary source of truth for structured, curated data.
   - A data lake was implemented to serve as a landing zone for raw, unstructured data from various sources, such as customer web logs, social media, and IoT sensors.

2. **Data Orchestration and Transformation**:
   - The company implemented a robust data orchestration and transformation layer, which facilitated the movement of data between the data lake and the EDW.
   - This layer ensured data quality, consistency, and adherence to business rules, enabling the seamless integration of data from the data lake into the EDW.

3. **Analytics and Insights**:
   - The company leveraged the data lake for exploratory and advanced analytics, such as customer segmentation, predictive maintenance, and supply chain optimization.
   - The EDW continued to serve as the primary source for traditional business intelligence and reporting, providing the necessary performance and data governance capabilities.

**The Outcome**:
The transition to the modern data warehouse architecture has yielded several benefits for the retail company:

- Improved data management and scalability: The data lake's ability to handle large volumes of raw, unstructured data has enabled the company to ingest and store a wider range of data sources, supporting more comprehensive business insights.
- Enhanced analytical capabilities: The combination of the data lake and the EDW has allowed the company to leverage both exploratory and structured analytics, leading to more informed decision-making.
- Increased operational efficiency: The automated data orchestration and transformation processes have reduced the manual effort required for data integration, freeing up IT resources for other strategic initiatives.
