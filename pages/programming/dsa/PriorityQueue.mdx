# Understanding Heap and Priority Queue DSA Problems: Patterns and Solutions

## Introduction

Heaps and Priority Queues are fundamental data structures that play a crucial role in solving various algorithmic problems efficiently. Understanding the common patterns in these problems is essential for developers preparing for technical interviews or working on performance-critical applications. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the key patterns and techniques used to solve Heap and Priority Queue problems effectively.

## Pattern 1: K-th Element Pattern

### Description
This pattern involves finding the k-th largest/smallest element in a dataset using a heap. It's one of the most common applications of heaps in problem-solving.

### Context and Importance
The k-th element pattern is crucial when we need to maintain a running set of top/bottom k elements efficiently. It's particularly useful in streaming data scenarios or when working with large datasets.

### How to Recognize
- Problem asks for the k-th largest/smallest element
- Need to maintain top/bottom k elements
- Involves processing elements one by one
- Memory constraints prevent sorting the entire dataset

### Approach
1. Choose min-heap for k-th largest or max-heap for k-th smallest
2. Initialize heap with first k elements
3. Process remaining elements:
   - Compare with heap top
   - Push/pop elements to maintain k size
4. Return heap top

### Example Problem
Find the k-th largest element in an array.

### Solution
```python
import heapq

def findKthLargest(nums, k):
    min_heap = []
    
    for num in nums:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, num)
        if len(min_heap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(min_heap)
    
    return min_heap[0]
```

### Algorithm Explanation
We maintain a min-heap of size k. For each element, we push it into the heap and if the heap size exceeds k, we remove the smallest element. After processing all elements, the top of the heap will be the k-th largest element.

## Pattern 2: Merge K Sorted Pattern

### Description
This pattern involves merging multiple sorted sequences efficiently using a heap to track the smallest/largest elements across all sequences.

### Context and Importance
This pattern is essential when dealing with distributed data or when memory constraints prevent loading all data at once.

### How to Recognize
- Multiple sorted input sequences
- Need to merge while maintaining order
- Memory efficiency is important
- Similar to merge sort but with k sequences

### Approach
1. Create a min-heap to store one element from each sequence
2. Initialize heap with first element from each sequence
3. While heap is not empty:
   - Pop smallest element
   - Add next element from same sequence
4. Continue until all elements processed

### Example Problem
Merge k sorted linked lists.

### Solution
```python
import heapq

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def mergeKLists(lists):
    heap = []
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    current = dummy
    
    # Initialize heap with first nodes
    for i, lst in enumerate(lists):
        if lst:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (lst.val, i, lst))
    
    while heap:
        val, i, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
        current.next = ListNode(val)
        current = current.next
        
        if node.next:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (node.next.val, i, node.next))
    
    return dummy.next
```

### Algorithm Explanation
We maintain a min-heap containing one node from each list. Each heap entry contains the node value, list index, and node reference. We continuously pop the smallest element and add the next element from the same list until all elements are processed.

## Pattern 3: Continuous Median Pattern

### Description
This pattern involves maintaining two heaps to efficiently track the median of a stream of numbers.

### Context and Importance
Finding the median in a dynamic dataset is crucial for statistical analysis and real-time data processing.

### How to Recognize
- Need to find median in streaming data
- Continuous updates to dataset
- Need quick access to middle elements
- Balance between two halves is important

### Approach
1. Maintain max-heap for lower half and min-heap for upper half
2. Balance heaps after each insertion
3. Median is either top of one heap or average of both tops

### Example Problem
Design a data structure that supports adding numbers and finding the median.

### Solution
```python
import heapq

class MedianFinder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.small = []  # max heap
        self.large = []  # min heap
    
    def addNum(self, num):
        if len(self.small) == len(self.large):
            heapq.heappush(self.large, -heapq.heappushpop(self.small, -num))
        else:
            heapq.heappush(self.small, -heapq.heappushpop(self.large, num))
    
    def findMedian(self):
        if len(self.small) == len(self.large):
            return (-self.small[0] + self.large[0]) / 2
        return self.large[0]
```

### Algorithm Explanation
We maintain two heaps: a max-heap for the lower half and a min-heap for the upper half. When adding numbers, we ensure the heaps remain balanced or differ by at most one element. The median is either the average of the tops of both heaps or the top of the larger heap.

## Pattern 4: Sliding Window Maximum Pattern

### Description
This pattern combines heap operations with sliding window technique to track maximum/minimum elements within a sliding window.

### Context and Importance
Essential for problems involving moving ranges and dynamic maximum/minimum tracking.

### How to Recognize
- Fixed or variable size window
- Need to track maximum/minimum in window
- Window slides through data
- Elements expire as window moves

### Approach
1. Use heap to store window elements with indices
2. Remove expired elements when window moves
3. Maintain heap property while sliding

### Example Problem
Find maximum element in all sliding windows of size k.

### Solution
```python
import heapq

def maxSlidingWindow(nums, k):
    result = []
    heap = []
    
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        heapq.heappush(heap, (-num, i))
        
        if i >= k - 1:
            while heap and heap[0][1] <= i - k:
                heapq.heappop(heap)
            result.append(-heap[0][0])
    
    return result
```

### Algorithm Explanation
We use a max-heap to store elements with their indices. As the window slides, we remove elements that are no longer in the current window. The top of the heap gives us the maximum element in the current window.

## Pattern 5: Task Scheduling Pattern

### Description
This pattern uses heaps to efficiently schedule tasks based on priorities, cooldown periods, or other constraints.

### Context and Importance
Critical for resource management and scheduling problems in operating systems and distributed computing.

### How to Recognize
- Tasks with priorities or frequencies
- Cooldown or waiting periods
- Need to optimize task completion
- Resource constraints

### Approach
1. Use heap to store tasks by priority
2. Track completion times or cooldowns
3. Process highest priority tasks first
4. Handle waiting periods efficiently

### Example Problem
Schedule tasks with cooldown period between same tasks.

### Solution
```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

def leastInterval(tasks, n):
    # Count task frequencies
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    for task in tasks:
        freq[task] += 1
    
    # Create max heap (-count, task)
    heap = []
    for task, count in freq.items():
        heapq.heappush(heap, (-count, task))
    
    time = 0
    while heap:
        i, temp = 0, []
        while i <= n:
            if heap:
                count, task = heapq.heappop(heap)
                if count + 1 < 0:
                    temp.append((count + 1, task))
            if not heap and not temp:
                break
            time += 1
            i += 1
        
        for item in temp:
            heapq.heappush(heap, item)
    
    return time
```

### Algorithm Explanation
We use a max-heap to store task frequencies. We process tasks in order of frequency, maintaining the cooldown period between same tasks. When a task is executed, we decrease its frequency and re-add it to the heap if needed.

## Conclusion

Understanding these heap and priority queue patterns is crucial for solving a wide range of algorithmic problems efficiently. These patterns provide powerful tools for handling ordered data, maintaining running statistics, and optimizing resource allocation. Practice implementing these patterns will improve your problem-solving skills and prepare you for technical interviews and real-world applications.
