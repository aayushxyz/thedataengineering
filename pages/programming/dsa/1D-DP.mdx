# Understanding 1-D Dynamic Programming DSA Problems: Patterns and Solutions

## Introduction

One-Dimensional Dynamic Programming (1-D DP) is a fundamental technique in algorithmic problem-solving that involves breaking down complex problems into simpler subproblems and storing their solutions to avoid redundant calculations. Understanding common patterns in 1-D DP problems is crucial for developers preparing for technical interviews or working on optimization problems. This blog post will explore key patterns and provide detailed solutions to help you master 1-D Dynamic Programming.

## Pattern 1: Linear Sequence Optimization

### Description
This pattern involves optimizing values in a linear sequence, where each decision depends on previous calculations. The solution typically requires building a DP array where each element represents the optimal value up to that position.

### Context and Importance
Linear sequence optimization is fundamental in DP problems and appears frequently in real-world scenarios, such as resource allocation and path optimization problems.

### How to Recognize
- Problems involving a linear sequence of elements
- Need to find optimal values (maximum/minimum)
- Current decision depends on previous decisions
- Cannot modify the sequence order

### Approach
1. Create a DP array to store optimal values
2. Define base cases
3. Establish the recurrence relation
4. Iterate through the sequence
5. Return the final optimal value

### Example Problem
Given an array of integers, find the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements.

### Solution
```python
def max_non_adjacent_sum(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    if len(nums) == 1:
        return nums[0]
        
    dp = [0] * len(nums)
    dp[0] = nums[0]
    dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])
    
    for i in range(2, len(nums)):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])
    
    return dp[-1]
```

### Algorithm Explanation
The algorithm maintains a DP array where dp[i] represents the maximum sum possible up to index i. For each position, we either include the current element and take the sum two positions back (dp[i-2] + nums[i]) or exclude it and take the previous maximum (dp[i-1]). The final answer is stored in the last element of the DP array.

## Pattern 2: Fibonacci-Style Sequence

### Description
This pattern follows the Fibonacci sequence structure, where each value depends on a fixed number of previous values. The solution typically involves maintaining a sliding window of previous results.

### Context and Importance
Fibonacci-style problems are common in DP and help understand how to optimize space complexity by maintaining only necessary previous values.

### How to Recognize
- Each value depends on k previous values
- Need to calculate nth term or reach a target
- Similar to climbing stairs or jumping problems

### Approach
1. Identify the number of previous values needed
2. Initialize base cases
3. Build the sequence using the recurrence relation
4. Optimize space by maintaining only necessary values

### Example Problem
Calculate the number of ways to climb n stairs if you can take 1 or 2 steps at a time.

### Solution
```python
def climb_stairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
        
    prev1, prev2 = 2, 1
    
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        current = prev1 + prev2
        prev2 = prev1
        prev1 = current
    
    return prev1
```

### Algorithm Explanation
Instead of maintaining a full DP array, we only keep track of the last two values needed for calculation. At each step, we calculate the current value as the sum of the previous two values and update our sliding window of values.

## Pattern 3: Prefix/Suffix Optimization

### Description
This pattern involves calculating optimal values from both ends of a sequence and combining them to find the final solution. It often requires maintaining prefix and suffix arrays or values.

### Context and Importance
Prefix/Suffix optimization is crucial for problems where decisions at one position depend on both previous and future elements.

### How to Recognize
- Need to consider elements from both directions
- Optimal solution depends on both left and right sides
- Problems involving splitting arrays or strings

### Approach
1. Create prefix and suffix arrays/values
2. Calculate optimal values from both directions
3. Combine results to find the final solution
4. Optimize space if possible

### Example Problem
Find the maximum product of two non-overlapping subarrays in a given array.

### Solution
```python
def max_product_split(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    prefix_max = [0] * n
    suffix_max = [0] * n
    
    # Calculate prefix maximums
    current_sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        current_sum += nums[i]
        prefix_max[i] = max(current_sum, prefix_max[i-1] if i > 0 else current_sum)
    
    # Calculate suffix maximums
    current_sum = 0
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        current_sum += nums[i]
        suffix_max[i] = max(current_sum, suffix_max[i+1] if i < n-1 else current_sum)
    
    # Find maximum product
    max_product = float('-inf')
    for i in range(n-1):
        max_product = max(max_product, prefix_max[i] * suffix_max[i+1])
    
    return max_product
```

### Algorithm Explanation
The algorithm maintains two arrays: prefix_max for maximum sums from left to right, and suffix_max for maximum sums from right to left. It then finds the optimal split point by iterating through the array and calculating the product of prefix and suffix maximums at each position.

## Pattern 4: State Transition

### Description
This pattern involves transitioning between different states, where each state represents a specific condition or choice. The solution requires tracking optimal values for each state.

### Context and Importance
State transition problems are common in real-world scenarios where systems can exist in different states and we need to find optimal transitions.

### How to Recognize
- Multiple possible states at each position
- Need to track different conditions
- Transitions between states have associated costs/values

### Approach
1. Identify possible states
2. Create DP arrays for each state
3. Define transition rules
4. Calculate optimal values for each state
5. Return the best final state

### Example Problem
Given an array of stock prices, find the maximum profit with at most one transaction (buy and sell).

### Solution
```python
def max_profit(prices):
    if not prices:
        return 0
        
    min_price = float('inf')
    max_profit = 0
    
    for price in prices:
        min_price = min(min_price, price)
        max_profit = max(max_profit, price - min_price)
    
    return max_profit
```

### Algorithm Explanation
The algorithm maintains two states: the minimum price seen so far and the maximum profit possible. For each price, we update the minimum price if necessary and calculate the potential profit if we sell at the current price.

## Pattern 5: Decision Making

### Description
This pattern involves making optimal decisions at each step, where each decision affects future possibilities. The solution requires evaluating all possible choices at each step.

### Context and Importance
Decision making problems are crucial in optimization scenarios where we need to choose the best action from multiple possibilities.

### How to Recognize
- Multiple choices at each step
- Need to maximize/minimize some value
- Current decision affects future possibilities

### Approach
1. Identify possible decisions at each step
2. Create DP array to store optimal values
3. Evaluate all possible decisions
4. Choose the best decision
5. Build the solution

### Example Problem
Given a list of coins and a target amount, find the minimum number of coins needed to make that amount.

### Solution
```python
def coin_change(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if coin <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

### Algorithm Explanation
For each amount from 1 to the target, we try using each coin and choose the minimum number of coins needed. The DP array stores the minimum number of coins needed for each amount, and we build up to the target amount.
