# About Me

Hi, I'm **Aayush Sharma**, a data engineer with 4+ years of experience in building robust data systems. This platform is my way of **learning in public** and **building in public**. As I prepare for advanced data engineering roles and continue my journey, I'm creating the resource I wish I had when I started—a place where aspiring data engineers can learn, build, and grow together.

TheDataEngineering.com was born from a simple observation: while there are many resources available to learn data engineering, there's no single platform that combines **structured learning**, **practical projects**, and **interview-preparation**—all for free.

Like many of you, I once struggled to find a structured path to learn data engineering. Despite countless courses and tutorials available online, I found myself missing the practical, hands on-driven learning experience that's crucial for real growth in this field. My journey has been about embracing challenges, learning from failures, and continuously evolving.

I wish to create a platform where we can:

- **Learning by Doing:** Building real-world projects to solidify and apply knowledge.
- **Community-Driven Growth:** Collaborating and supporting each other to achieve success.
- **Open Access to Quality Education:** Keeping all core content free and accessible.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Staying curious, embracing change, and refining skills as technologies evolve.
- **Practical Problem Solving:** Focusing on actionable solutions that tackle everyday data engineering challenges.


This is just the beginning. As our community grows, so will our resources, projects, and collective knowledge. Whether you're just starting out or looking to level up your data engineering skills, you'll find a supportive, innovative community here ready to help you succeed.


Join me on this exciting journey as we explore, experiment, and innovate. Together, we can create tools, share insights, and build a future where data engineering is accessible to everyone.
