# Ingestion

1. Introduction to Data Ingestion
- Definition and importance
- Role in data engineering lifecycle
- Types of data ingestion (batch vs real-time)
- Common challenges and considerations

2. Core Concepts of Data Ingestion
- Bounded vs Unbounded Data
- Push vs Pull vs Poll patterns
- Synchronous vs Asynchronous ingestion
- Batch vs Stream processing
- ETL vs ELT approaches
- Data serialization and deserialization
- Data formats (JSON, CSV, Avro, Parquet, etc.)

3. Key Engineering Considerations
- Scalability and throughput
- Reliability and fault tolerance
- Data quality and validation
- Security and compliance
- Performance optimization
- Cost considerations
- Monitoring and logging

4. Batch Ingestion
- Characteristics and use cases
- Tools and technologies
  * AWS Glue
  * Apache Spark
  * AWS EMR
  * AWS DMS
- Best practices
- Scheduling and orchestration
- Error handling
- File-based ingestion patterns
- Incremental vs full loads

5. Real-time/Stream Ingestion
- Characteristics and use cases
- Tools and technologies
  * Amazon Kinesis
  * Amazon MSK (Kafka)
  * Apache Kafka
  * DynamoDB Streams
- Message handling
- Late arriving data
- Ordering and deduplication
- Error handling and dead letter queues
- Scaling considerations
